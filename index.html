            <p>
                Hello! My name is Brandy Nogales, and I am currently pursuing an MSc in Cyber Security at ETHZ-EPFL, Zurich. 
                I hold a BSc in Computer Sciences and a BSc in Psychology from the University of Geneva. My expertise includes 
                a range of programming languages such as Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Scala. I have substantial 
                experience in software engineering, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. In addition to my technical skills, 
                I am proficient in English, French, and Spanish.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my academic and professional career, I have led software engineering projects, developed full-stack 
                applications, and conducted research in the field of emotionally intelligent peripherals for video games. 
                My recent work at ETHZ focused on exploiting system vulnerabilities and machine learning attacks. I am 
                passionate about literature, astronomy, photography, and boxing.
